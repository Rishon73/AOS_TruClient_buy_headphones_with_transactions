# AOS_TruClient_buy_headphones_with_transactions

This is a simple Mobile Native TruClient script for iOS devices.

The script was Built with VUGen v12.56, which later was updated to v12.60 and MC v2.80
I used the 1.1.4, Enterprise signed, AOS version to create and run this script. It may work with other versions as well, but I haven't tested it.

If you use the Enterprise signed app, you may need to verify/accept the app:
* __In iOS 12, go to:__ _Settings > General > Device Management > Micro Focus Ltd. > and verify/accept the Advantage Shopping app._
* __In older versions, go to:__ _Settings > General > Profiles > Micro Focus Ltd. > and verify/accept the Advantage Shopping app_.

#### Usage:
Once you've launched the script in VUGen, you'll need to update your MC credentials in the script:
_Develop Script > Expend the 'Connet to Mobile Center Server' > Expend the 'Arguments'_
