# AOS_TruClient_buy_headphones_with_transactions

This is a simple Mobile Native TruClient script for iOS devices.<br>
The script was Built with VUGen v12.56, which later was updated to v12.60 and MC v2.80<br>
I used the 1.1.4, Enterprise signed, AOS version to create and run this script. It may work with other versions as well, but I haven't tested it.<br>
<br>
If you use the Enterprise signed app, you may need to verify/accept the app:<br>
<li><b>In iOS 12, go to:</b> <i>Settings > General > Device Management > Micro Focus Ltd. > and verify/accept the Advantage Shopping</i> app.<br>
<li><b>In older versions, go to:</b> <i>Settings > General > Profiles > Micro Focus Ltd. > and verify/accept the Advantage Shopping</i> app.<br>


#### Usage:
Once you've launched the script in VUGen, you'll need to update your MC credentials in the script:<br>
<i>Develop Script \> Expend the 'Connet to Mobile Center Server' \> Expend the 'Arguments'</i>
